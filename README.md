# Project-2
----------*This project is Called "Flight Booking Management System"*-----------

# Objectif: 
  The objectif of this project is to learn the basic of C++ language. And using specific required concepts such as Array, Structure and Enumeration, String and Stream, Pointers and functions.

# Bref Explanation of the Program:
  This program is to to simulate a basic flight booking management system that manage passenger details and flight schedules. The program will use a basic function to allow the user to search flight, choose a seats and manage the passenger information. Then, use an array to manage the flight schedules, pointers to manage dynamically allocated passengers details. Also, it will define two struct for "passenger" and "flights" and each struct have their own details. And enum for seat classes like (economy, firstclass, or business). And last using a string and stream operation to store the passenegers names, destinations details. 
  
  The program will be in separate files: Project-two.cpp/Header.h/Source.cpp
